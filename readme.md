Here we are creat8ng a node.js and using the express module (installing express) to create an express app
Express app running a server that listens on a specified port
An Ajax call to the url at that database can directly access the database using a single url string
The url string has a route/path, and the express app will respond with the appropriate database info 
The blog post is retrieving the data stored in that database
